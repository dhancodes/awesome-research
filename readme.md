# Awesome Research

As PhD students and researchers, we find ourselves navigating a complex
landscape, and the right software can make all the difference. I have compiled
a list of software tools that have proven invaluable to myself and my friends
who are pursuing their PhDs. These tools have enhanced our research process,
and boosted productivity.

**Disclaimer:** The installation of softwares included in the list is 
with `Ubuntu/Debian` in mind. Other Linux distro user can figure it out and
good luck to the Windows Users.

## Tools

### Editors
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/): A simple editor which runs in your terminal. If you what a more
graphical approach you can try gvim. And vim has famous fork called [neovim](https://neovim.io/) which
emphasises more on customizability as it uses a programming language called [lua](https://www.lua.org/) 
for customizaition. while vim relies on Vimscript for its customization

```bash
sudo apt install gvim
sudo apt install neovim
```
- [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): 
- [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
