# Awesome Research âœ¨

As PhD students and researchers, we find ourselves navigating a complex
landscape, and the right software can make all the difference. I have compiled
a list of software tools that have proven invaluable to myself and my friends
who are pursuing their PhDs. These tools have enhanced our research process,
and boosted productivity.

**Disclaimer:** The installation instructions for the listed software are
tailored for `Ubuntu/Debian`. Users of other Linux distributions can adapt
accordingly, and good luck to Windows users.

## Tools

### Editors
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/): A simple editor which runs in your terminal. If you what a more
graphical approach you can try gvim. And vim has famous fork called [neovim](https://neovim.io/) which
emphasises more on customizability as it uses a programming language called [lua](https://www.lua.org/) 
for customizaition. while vim relies on Vimscript for its customization

```bash
sudo apt install gvim
sudo apt install neovim
```

- [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): The preferred editor for most developers, owned by Microsoft. Its popularity is attributed to a broad user base and the availability of plugins. For an open-source version, refer to [this link](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode). If you have Snap installed, use the following command:
```bash
sudo snap install code --classic
```

- [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/): A twist to the popular IPython format, Jupyter Notebooks is named after Julia, Python, and R, the three languages it supports. It can also be configured for languages such as Haskell, Ruby, Sage, etc.

```bash
pip install jupyterlab 
```

- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/linux_repositories.html):
  Renowned for its exceptional speed as an editor, Sublime Text is favored for
  its efficiency and sleek design. Although the application is not available in
  APT, you can manually add the repository to APT and install it.

- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/): A robust integrated
  development environment (IDE) tailored for Python, PyCharm is developed by
  JetBrains. By beware as the application is proprietary and doesn't have
  an opensource counterpart.

- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/): A cloud-based platform
  offered by Google, Google Colab is a free, interactive, and collaborative
  environment tailored for data science and machine learning. Utilizing
  Google's infrastructure, it enables users to write and execute Python code
  directly in a browser, eliminating the need for local installations. It
  excels in scenarios where sharing code with others is crucial or when local
  system resources are limited.

### Figures/Mindmaps
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/): Inkscape is a Free and open source
  vector graphics editor for GNU/Linux, Windows and macOS. It offers a rich
  set of features and is widely used for both artistic and technical
  illustrations such as cartoons, clip art, logos, typography, diagramming
  and flowcharting.
  ```bash
  sudo apt install inkscape
  ```

- [Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org):GeoGebra is a dynamic mathematics
  software for all levels of education that brings together geometry, algebra,
  spreadsheets, graphing, statistics and calculus in one engine. In addition,
  we can generate also use it to generate graphs and geometric shapes.
  ```bash
  sudo apt install geogebra
  ```
- [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/): It is a freely distributed program for
  such tasks as photo retouching, image composition and image authoring.
  ```bash
  sudo apt install gimp
  ```
- [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/): Used to create diagrams
  such as flowcharts, wireframes, organizational charts, and
  network diagrams. But at the end it's just a website which has
  lot of templates.
- Biorender
- Prism

### Versioning
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): A awesome versioning system. A word of advice, if you code spend some time to learn git.
